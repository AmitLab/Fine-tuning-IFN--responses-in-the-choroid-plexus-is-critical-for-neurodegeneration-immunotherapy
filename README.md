Fine-tuning IFN-γ responses in the choroid plexus is critical for neurodegeneration immunotherapy
The immunological milieu of the brain’s choroid plexus (CP) influences brain function. Particularly, the type of interferon signals, IFN-γ or IFN-I, are critical determinants. Here we show that a well-balanced IFN-γ signaling in the CP is required for the beneficial effect of systemic immune checkpoint PD-L1 blockade in ameliorating disease in 5xFAD amyloidosis mice. Analyzing CP transcriptome data indicated prevailing IFN-I over IFN-γ responses in the CP in brain diseases, whereas anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in 5xFAD mice was associated with a shift in this relationship in favor of IFN-γ. Transcriptome analysis of primary mouse CP cultures exposed to IFN-γ emphasized the importance of finely tuning the stimulus to support brain protection while avoiding adverse effects. Our study highlights the crucial role of CP responsivity to IFN-γ in efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade against neurodegeneration and lifelong brain’s health.
